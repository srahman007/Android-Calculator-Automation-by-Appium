# Android-Calculator-Automation-by-Appium

## Description
This is mainly a test project of Android Calculator.apk file. Here I just downloaded an android calculator .apk file from "google play store" and made an operation on it by the help of appium server and "Appium Inspector" app to coonnect my android phone with my personal computer. I made an automation operation "100/10*5-10+60=100" to see if my android phone behaves perfectly and do the calculation right.

## Prerequisites
- ```calculator.apk```
- ```Android Inspector```
- ```Android Studio```
- ```IntellIJ```

## How to run?
- Download & Install Prerequisites
- Setup system environment settings
- Open cmd and write "appium" to start the appium server
