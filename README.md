# Android-Calculator-Automation-by-Appium

## Description
This is mainly a test project of Android Calculator.apk file. Here I just downloaded an android calculator .apk file from "google play store" and made an operation on it by the help of appium server and "Appium Inspector" app to coonnect my android phone with my personal computer. I made an automation operation "100/10*5-10+60=100" to see if my android phone behaves perfectly and do the calculation right.

## Prerequisites
- ```calculator.apk```
- ```Android Inspector```
- ```Android Studio```
- ```IntellIJ```

## How to run?
- Download & Install Prerequisites
- Setup system environment settings
- Open cmd and write "appium" to start the appium server
- Connect your Android phone with your PC and turn on "developer mode", "OEM" & "USB Debugging" for the connection
- Open Appium Inspector and fillup "platformName", "platformVersion", "appPackage", "appActivity", "app" and set their address into the "Value" section. You can find the value of appActivity from Android Studio by run the calculator.apk on it and copy the "com.android.calculator2.Calculator" address from their and paste it into Appium Inspector
- Download the build file from github and run
